/// `TrackMode` struct, and a CD can mix and match tracks of
/// different types in arbitrary orders.
///
/// The CUE sheet format represents its time codes
/// in a `MM:SS:FR` format, which is based on the `MIN`, `SEC` and `FRAC`
/// fields defined by the CD standard. `FRAC` is a fraction
/// representing 1/75th of a second, which is the size of a single
/// CD sector.
/// The timecodes returned by this struct have been parsed into
/// sequential sector counts.
///
/// Aside from the track itself, this struct also represents the
/// regions immediately before and after the track. These regions
/// of a disc, known as the pregap and postgap, are not contained
/// within any track but do have their own timecodes. They are
/// usually silent but occasionally contain sound as a form of
/// easter egg.

/// * Pregap (if present)
/// * Track
/// * Postgap (if present)
/// * Next track's pregap (if present)
